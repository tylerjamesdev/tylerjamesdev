## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Tyler

I am a backend developer who happens to be not THAT bad at frontend.ðŸ˜‰<br/>
I enjoy the entire tech stack and all things programming.<br/>
My goal is always to deliver enjoyable user experiences through clean and organized frontends, powered by fast and scalable backend systems.<br/>
